# Comprehensive Diabetes Model Schema
This repository is home to the JSON Schema used to validate the comprehensive
diabetes model. It is a collaborative effort between 
[RTI International Center for Data Science](https://www.rti.org/service-capability/data-science)
and [Squishymedia](https://squishymedia.com/).

This schema is used to validate a model configuration file. It is written using the 
[draft-04](http://json-schema.org/draft-04/json-schema-core.html) specification.
